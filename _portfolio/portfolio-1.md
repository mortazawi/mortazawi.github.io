title: "Generative AI"
excerpt: "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) creates new content by modeling complex patterns in existing datasets. Unlike traditional AI systems, it goes beyond classification or prediction to generate novel outputs that resemble human creativity. It supports decision-making with synthetic data for scenarios where real data is scarce or sensitive.<br/><br/><img src='/images/GenAI.png'>"

The future of generative AI will increasingly center on agentic systems—models that don’t just respond to prompts but can act autonomously, plan ahead, and execute multi-step tasks with minimal human supervision. These AI agents will function more like digital coworkers, capable of integrating tools, APIs, and databases to carry out workflows end-to-end. In enterprise settings, they could handle everything from customer support and data analysis to supply-chain optimization, while coordinating with other agents in complex ecosystems. The challenge will be balancing autonomy with safety, ensuring robust oversight, accountability, and guardrails against unintended actions.
