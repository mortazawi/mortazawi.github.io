I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto, Canada, in 2025, under the supervision of [Prof. Elvino S. Sousa](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/sousa-e-s/). My research ranges from data-driven machine learning techniques for large-scale distributed optimization to graph neural networks and transformer-based architectures for structured data. I strive to develop intelligent, reliable, and scalable AI systems that translate cutting-edge research into real-world impact.
